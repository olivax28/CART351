                            Week 01 started with an introduction to the class and a syllabus overview. As a class, we
                            interacted
                            with a website which could recieve input from the entire class, displaying messages that
                            were
                            inputted by the users. Although the exercise was simple, I am interested to see what type of
                            wider
                            implementations this sort of group-oriented information input can have, and how it can
                            artistically
                            change an interactive project.
                        <p>
                            I am also very interested in the course's focus on learning Python. Up until
                            now I've only had experience with JavaScript and, knowing that Python is widely used and
                            applied
                            in
                            various ways, I am excited to be able to learn such a flexible language.

                        <p>
                            This week I began doing simple coding in Python through the Worksheet that was assigned,
                            here
                            are my impressions so far.
                        </p>
                        I find that, so far as the simple worksheet goes, the syntax is easier for me to grasp compared
                        to
                        JavaScript, and reads more easily like English. This being said, I am able to grasp the logic of
                        the code better. I even found that while I would have a moment of confusion at first glance at
                        the code to edit, I would quickly be able to understand it, especially by reading it out loud. I
                        hope that this keeps up further down the line and that I can more easily use
                        this language to code complex and interesting projects, taking advantage of Python's
                        affordances.
                        <p>
                            The only thing that is surprising to me in terms of the python workflow is the need to set
                            up an 'environment' which, to my understanding, can actually interact with other aplications
                            in the computer being used if not set up correctly, especially while working on more complex
                            projects. I am also intrigued by the fact that the work being done in the script cannot
                            immediately be visually displayed, such as when I was learning JavaScript. In any case,
                            these are
                            workflows I will have to get used to, and I am nonetheless interested in future projects.

                        After the in-class python exercise, I still hold up my opinion that I am grasping Python better
                        than JavaScript so far. As well, I am really intrigued with the creative potential that
                        accessing APIs can have for future projects. With so much readily accessible information, I can
                        only to begin to imagine how this data can be manipulated in unique ways to create narrative and
                        visually interesting interactive code.

                        Flask seems to me like like an interesting middleground between JavsScript and Python. Of
                        course, Flask is powered by Python but a someone who has only used Python for terminal input up
                        until now, I am very intrigued by the possibility to start building front-facing user
                        interfaces. Quite unfortunately, I am coming down with a cold this week but nonetheless I am
                        anticipating the first project and am an interested in what sort of end product will come from
                        its guidelines.

                        Although class was sadly cancelled this week, I took the the extra time to complete
                        Project01 with Julia. On completion of the project, here are some of my thoughts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        Firstly, going back to my post in week 03, it was interesting to dive into the creative
                        potential that Python holds, even in a simple terminal-based program. What strikes me most is
                        how easy the process is to take input from a user and return information based on it, creating a
                        solid base for simple interactivity. The way that Python functions allows for an easy flow from
                        program to user, which is definitely something I would like to further look into and utilize in
                        future projects.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As seen here, using simple 'if' statements allowed to create a simulation of a conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        As well, the project allowed for the start of some experimentation with data. Considering that
                        our project revolved around a scientist character, we tried to take advatange of the data for
                        storytelling in simple but unexpected ways. For example, I really liked the graph that displayed
                        a different ASCII face depending on the AQI information.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        Although the project was fairly simple in its design, I believe that it was a good introduction
                        to utilizing Python for different forms of storytelling, and represents different aspects of how
                        Python's affordances can be used in future projects.

                        This week saw a deeper dive into Flask and the assigning of the in-class exercise 02, which I
                        finished later in the week. Admittedly, during the in-class lecture I felt as if I was a little
                        lost with the material. However, as I started the in-class exercise, I quickly became accustomed
                        to the Flask workflow, and the lesson began to make sense to me. In fact, the assignment took
                        little time to complete. The creative use of inputted data was particularly interesting. During
                        project 01, the user input was limited by the keywords that were predetermined by my (and
                        Julia's) code, with the more creative code being used to manipulate the data from the API.
                        However, it seems that the flask pipeline, as was practiced in the in-class assignment, will
                        lead to a more dynamic user experience, given that the forms can accept many different types of
                        input before returning them to the user. For example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/Task03.png" width="500" height="250">

                    </p>
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        In the image above, done for the in class assignment, information from a form was transformed so
                        that a different message and image would be displayed depending in the existence of a vowel in
                        the data. Of course, this is a very simple sort of manipulation of user data. However, the mix
                        of instant visible results, in the form of a Flask application, and the ability to accept a
                        wider input from the user builds the base for interesting interactive experiences.

                        I am excited to begin working on project 02, which requires that we create a full working Flask

                        a little intimidating for my first time, I am invested in creating a visually and conceptually
