                            Week 01 started with an introduction to the class and a syllabus overview. As a class, we
                            interacted
                            with a website which could recieve input from the entire class, displaying messages that
                            were
                            inputted by the users. Although the exercise was simple, I am interested to see what type of
                            wider
                            implementations this sort of group-oriented information input can have, and how it can
                            artistically
                            change an interactive project.
                        <p>
                            I am also very interested in the course's focus on learning Python. Up until
                            now I've only had experience with JavaScript and, knowing that Python is widely used and
                            applied
                            in
                            various ways, I am excited to be able to learn such a flexible language.

                        <p>
                            This week I began doing simple coding in Python through the Worksheet that was assigned,
                            here
                            are my impressions so far.
                        </p>
                        I find that, so far as the simple worksheet goes, the syntax is easier for me to grasp compared
                        to
                        JavaScript, and reads more easily like English. This being said, I am able to grasp the logic of
                        the code better. I even found that while I would have a moment of confusion at first glance at
                        the code to edit, I would quickly be able to understand it, especially by reading it out loud. I
                        hope that this keeps up further down the line and that I can more easily use
                        this language to code complex and interesting projects, taking advantage of Python's
                        affordances.
                        <p>
                            The only thing that is surprising to me in terms of the python workflow is the need to set
                            up an 'environment' which, to my understanding, can actually interact with other aplications
                            in the computer being used if not set up correctly, especially while working on more complex
                            projects. I am also intrigued by the fact that the work being done in the script cannot
                            immediately be visually displayed, such as when I was learning JavaScript. In any case,
                            these are
                            workflows I will have to get used to, and I am nonetheless interested in future projects.

                        After the in-class python exercise, I still hold up my opinion that I am grasping Python better
                        than JavaScript so far. As well, I am really intrigued with the creative potential that
                        accessing APIs can have for future projects. With so much readily accessible information, I can
                        only to begin to imagine how this data can be manipulated in unique ways to create narrative and
                        visually interesting interactive code.
