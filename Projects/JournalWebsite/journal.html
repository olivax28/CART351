                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        Week 01 started with an introduction to the class and a syllabus overview. As a class, we
                        interacted
                        with a website which could recieve input from the entire class, displaying messages that were
                        inputted by the users. Although the exercise was simple, I am interested to see what type of
                        wider
                        implementations this sort of group-oriented information input can have, and how it can
                        artistically
                        change an interactive project.
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        I am also very interested in the course's focus on learning Python. Up until
                        now I've only had experience with JavaScript and, knowing that Python is widely used and applied
                        in
                        various ways, I am excited to be able to learn such a flexible language.
