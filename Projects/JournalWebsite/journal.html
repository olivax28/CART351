                            Week 01 started with an introduction to the class and a syllabus overview. As a class, we
                            interacted
                            with a website which could recieve input from the entire class, displaying messages that
                            were
                            inputted by the users. Although the exercise was simple, I am interested to see what type of
                            wider
                            implementations this sort of group-oriented information input can have, and how it can
                            artistically
                            change an interactive project.
                        <p>
                            I am also very interested in the course's focus on learning Python. Up until
                            now I've only had experience with JavaScript and, knowing that Python is widely used and
                            applied
                            in
                            various ways, I am excited to be able to learn such a flexible language.

                        <p>
                            This week I began doing simple coding in Python through the Worksheet that was assigned,
                            here
                            are my impressions so far.
                        </p>
                        I find that, so far as the simple worksheet goes, the syntax is easier for me to grasp compared
                        to
                        JavaScript, and reads more easily like English. This being said, I am able to grasp the logic of
                        the code better. I even found that while I would have a moment of confusion at first glance at
                        the code to edit, I would quickly be able to understand it, especially by reading it out loud. I
                        hope that this keeps up further down the line and that I can more easily use
                        this language to code complex and interesting projects, taking advantage of Python's
                        affordances.
                        <p>
                            The only thing that is surprising to me in terms of the python workflow is the need to set
                            up an 'environment' which, to my understanding, can actually interact with other aplications
                            in the computer being used if not set up correctly, especially while working on more complex
                            projects. I am also intrigued by the fact that the work being done in the script cannot
                            immediately be visually displayed, such as when I was learning JavaScript. In any case,
                            these are
                            workflows I will have to get used to, and I am nonetheless interested in future projects.

                        After the in-class python exercise, I still hold up my opinion that I am grasping Python better
                        than JavaScript so far. As well, I am really intrigued with the creative potential that
                        accessing APIs can have for future projects. With so much readily accessible information, I can
                        only to begin to imagine how this data can be manipulated in unique ways to create narrative and
                        visually interesting interactive code.

                        Flask seems to me like like an interesting middleground between JavsScript and Python. Of
                        course, Flask is powered by Python but a someone who has only used Python for terminal input up
                        until now, I am very intrigued by the possibility to start building front-facing user
                        interfaces. Quite unfortunately, I am coming down with a cold this week but nonetheless I am
                        anticipating the first project and am an interested in what sort of end product will come from
                        its guidelines.

                        Although class was sadly cancelled this week, I took the the extra time to complete
                        Project01 with Julia. On completion of the project, here are some of my thoughts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        Firstly, going back to my post in week 03, it was interesting to dive into the creative
                        potential that Python holds, even in a simple terminal-based program. What strikes me most is
                        how easy the process is to take input from a user and return information based on it, creating a
                        solid base for simple interactivity. The way that Python functions allows for an easy flow from
                        program to user, which is definitely something I would like to further look into and utilize in
                        future projects.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As seen here, using simple 'if' statements allowed to create a simulation of a conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        As well, the project allowed for the start of some experimentation with data. Considering that
                        our project revolved around a scientist character, we tried to take advatange of the data for
                        storytelling in simple but unexpected ways. For example, I really liked the graph that displayed
                        a different ASCII face depending on the AQI information.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        Although the project was fairly simple in its design, I believe that it was a good introduction
                        to utilizing Python for different forms of storytelling, and represents different aspects of how
                        Python's affordances can be used in future projects.

                        This week saw a deeper dive into Flask and the assigning of the in-class exercise 02, which I
                        finished later in the week. Admittedly, during the in-class lecture I felt as if I was a little
                        lost with the material. However, as I started the in-class exercise, I quickly became accustomed
                        to the Flask workflow, and the lesson began to make sense to me. In fact, the assignment took
                        little time to complete. The creative use of inputted data was particularly interesting. During
                        project 01, the user input was limited by the keywords that were predetermined by my (and
                        Julia's) code, with the more creative code being used to manipulate the data from the API.
                        However, it seems that the flask pipeline, as was practiced in the in-class assignment, will
                        lead to a more dynamic user experience, given that the forms can accept many different types of
                        input before returning them to the user. For example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="assets/Task03.png" width="500" height="250">

                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        In the image above, done for the in class assignment, information from a form was transformed so
                        that a different message and image would be displayed depending in the existence of a vowel in
                        the data. Of course, this is a very simple sort of manipulation of user data. However, the mix
                        of instant visible results, in the form of a Flask application, and the ability to accept a
                        wider input from the user builds the base for interesting interactive experiences.

                        Sessions and cookies were covered this class, which to my understanding, provides the

                        not require a full page refresh every time something is meant to change in the user's view. This

                        This week's course was focused on saving data to a JSON file based on user input. It was very
                        interesting to see the data be added in real time, and to see the JavaScript, Python, html and
                        JSON files all working together. I thought back on my past semesters where I had learned how to
                        use these languages individually, and, in a way that felt rewarding, I could see all of these
                        different languages come together in order to make the beginnings of a functioning application.
                        In lieu of this, for the assigned class exercise I reached back to a p5 application I had made
                        for my JavaScript class during my first semester, and added the JSON reading code.
                        Unfortunately, I do find that I was rushed this week and I did not implement this new knowledge
                        to the old project as meaningfully as I could. However, it will nonetheless act as a good base
                        and reference for future projects which combine p5 interactivity and data storage.

                        This week, Julia and I teamed up once again to create project 02, Fortune Rookie. As assigned,
                        it applied the JSON reading functions in a more meaningful way through a Flask application. For
                        this project,
                        we developed a simple p5 application which took the user's name and birthday and, based on the
                        last two digits of their birthyear, returned one of four fortunes.
                    </p>

                        The initial state of the application upon being launched.

                    <p class="blogpostfontMain">
                        After the data was inputted, the Flask application stored this information in a JSON file, then
                        outputting it in a DIV, so that as different users input their own information, their results
                        are stored as "cards" which can be seen collectively. While rather simple in its functionality,
                        it was fun to begin thinking about storing larger amounts of data, and how this would create a
                        "community" around it through the different users. Thinking back on it, it would've been fun to
                        add another piece of user information; a comment on their recieved fortune which may help to
                        emphasize the connectivity created through the application's display of information

                        I think that this project also integrates well with this week's most recent lesson on Mongo,
                        which allows for the data base to be stored on a cloud, allowed for larger amounts of data that
                        can be accessed remotely. How would larger amounts of user input change the experience? What
                        aspects of the application would need to be moved or changed? These are some topics which I
                        began to think about during the lesson with regard to Fortune Rookie and future applications
                        based on the same languages.

                        with what we did given the time that we had to complete the assignment. As well, I am looking
                        forward to combining the data displaying affordances of Flask and JSON, with the storytelling
                        explorations through code of project01 in order to create a strong project 03.

                        Instead of a coding exercise for this week's in-class assignment, the time was taken instead to
                        view other student's project 02 and write a response to submit. This gave me the oppertunity to
                        see other people's work, which we haven't had yet as a class. Not only was it a nice change of
                        pace and an excuse to have conversation with classmates, but it was also useful in the fact that
                        it allowed for oppertunities to ask about the code and techniques used in these other projects.
                        I was glad to ask about these things and gather inspiration for our third and final project, as
                        I am still debating what I want to work on. One student suggested expanding on "Fortune Rookie,"
                        transforming it into a more colalborative application with the use of Mongo. While this is an
                        interesting suggestion, I am thinking that I would rather develop a new program, only building
                        off of what Fortune rookie does. In fact, I enjoy the flexibility of mixing p5 with Python
                        and pure JavaScript, especially given its affordabilities to be especially "game-like."

                        For this in-class assignment, we applied what was learned the week before, which was fetching
                        from Mongo the hosted JSON file. Interestingly, while I found actually extracting and organizing
                        the informaiton to be quite easy, the most challenging part was going back into my memories
                        from last semester in order to visualize the data with JavaScript. While I have done some
                        JavaScript this semester, it was relatively limited. However, although I did admittedly have
                        some difficulty with a few areas,I am still glad to have had the refresher, as it opens up new
                        possibilities when it comes to the visual part of project 03. Although I do think I will still
                        use p5 for a large part of the project, I did really like how in Project 02 (Fortune Rookie),
                        the p5 canvas had the ability to affect elements outside the canvas. That being said, it makes
                        me think of how this idea coul d be applied to a more artistic application in order to create a
                        feeling of a program interacting with elements beyond itself. Like, for example, a game which
                        unexpectedly affects the webpage it is being hosted on. In any case, it is an intersting
                        concept to take into account now that I need to begin work on project 03.

                        Wow! I can't believe it's already the end of the semester. I've submitted my final project and
                        as of now the only thing I have left to do is write this last journal entry, so now seems like a
                        good time for some reflection. Firstly, Teaming up with Julia again, I am quite happy with the
                        way that
                        our final project came out. I've said a lot of my thoughts in the reflection for the project,
                        but here I'd like to say that I feel like Julia and I ended up exploring what we wanted to in
                        terms of explorable, networked spaces.

                        Visually and thematically the project feels cohesive, and I like that in the end we were able to
                        create a data visualisation that connected the more thematic, almost storytelling elements with
                        the technical parts of Mongo and Python.

                        The mediaplayer in "Desktop Memories" represents each past user as a sprite related to the type
                        of memory they submitted.

                        Not only was this project fun to work on, especially due to its strong visual themes, but it
                        really did get me thinking more about how tradionally non-artistic mediums such as data and
                        coding can be renterpreted into more artistic and expressive uses. Of course, I already knew it
                        was posible due to my interest in gamemaking, however, I feel like trying to tie in interactive
                        and visual
                        concepts with a data-focused lens really got me thinking of the potential of creative expression
                        outside of gamke-making while still staying within the sphere of computers.

                        Overall, this was a very enjoyable semester. Not only did I learn about Mongo, Flask and coding
                        with Python, but I also had the oppertunity to practice and revisit p5, JavaScript and HTML, all
                        of which I feel more confident in.
